# Experiment 01 – Adders

## Aim
To design and implement Half Adder, Full Adder, and Ripple Carry Adder using Verilog on FPGA.

## Modules Included
1. Half Adder
2. Full Adder
3. Ripple Carry Adder

## Description
- Half Adder performs addition of two single-bit binary inputs.
- Full Adder performs addition of three single-bit binary inputs including carry.
- Ripple Carry Adder performs multi-bit binary addition by cascading full adder modules.

## Platform
- FPGA

## Language Used
- Verilog

## Tools Used
- Xilinx Vivado
- FPGA development board
